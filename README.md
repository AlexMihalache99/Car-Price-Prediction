# Car-Price-Prediction
This is my final year dissertation project.

Aims of the project:
- to explore the machine learning subject and understand how it works
- to identify the web scraping challenges and risks
- to build a car price prediction model which has a high accuracy
- to produce specification and evaluation criteria

Description of project files:
- <b>WebScraper.py</b> - file where scraping was done. I used pistonheads.com website for scraping car data.
- <b>cars_info.csv</b> - csv file where the scraped data is hold.
- <b>CarPricePrediction.ipynb</b> - file where machine learning techniques are used for prediction
- <b>Dissertation.pdf</b> - the documentation of the project

Machine learning algorithms used:
- <b>Linear Regression</b>
- <b>Extreme Gradient Boosting</b>
- <b>Random forest</b>
- <b>Artificial Neural Network</b>

For more technical references about the project, have a look in <b>Dissertation.pdf</b>.
