WebScraper.py - currently does not work as PistonHeads updated their website, but I managed to work with the data extracted in november(the extraction date can be seen in the .csv file)
cars_info.csv - csv file that holds the scraped data
CarPricePrediction.ipynb - there are not any specific requirements for the notebook, only to have all the imports installed in order to run
